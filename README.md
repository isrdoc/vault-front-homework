You will be provided with a backend with a search endpoint that handles the server part.
⚠️ There is a bug in the search code that you will have to fix 😏

The current frontend is very minimal and you will be in charge to:

- style the layout to match the above mockups (mockups are just here to give general idea, don't hesitate to choose any color scheme you like)
- create any components you would need and feel free to restructure the files architecture
- ⚠️ we intentionnally put some bugs/problems in the code, happy debugging 🥳
- add code quality tools (linting, formating)
- 🎁 **bonus** github action that runs those tools
- 🎁 **bonus** anything cool you have in mind

## Getting started
